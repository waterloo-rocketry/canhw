# Vent Board 

The purpose of the vent board is to open and close the valve that allows for nitrous oxide to flow into the rocket before launch. 

The vent itself is used to safely remove nitrous oxide gas from the rocket tank and also functions as a way for gases to escape from the rocket while the tank is being fueled.
