# Vent Board 

The purpose of the vent board is to open and close the valve that allows for nitrous oxide to flow into the rocket before launch. Similarly to the injector board, the vent board is powered from the CAN bus (logic power) and from an external battery (valve power). The linear actuator that forms the vent valve is controlled using potentiometer feedback and a pair of programmable DACs. As such, the limits of the linear actuator can be easily programmed and modified. 

The vent itself is used to safely remove nitrous oxide gas from the rocket tank and also functions as a way for gases to escape from the rocket while the tank is being fueled.
